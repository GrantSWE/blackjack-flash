<h1>Blackjack Flash</h1>
<p>
    Developed this small application to help keep 'running count' through a deck of cards, and to keep coding in cpp.
</p>
<p>
    I have plans of using 'Flash' as a game mode, accompanied with 'Basic Strategy', 'True Count', and 'Game Simulation'.

    I have also started to develop a graphic card set instead of using symbols. This can be seen in the "displayDigitalCard" function.
