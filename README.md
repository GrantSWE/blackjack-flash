<h1>Blackjack Flash</h1>
<p>
    Developed this small application quite a while ago to help me keep running count through a deck of cards, and to sharpen my C++.
</p>
<p>
    I have plans of using 'Flash' as a game mode, accompanied with 'Basic Strategy', 'True Count', and 'Game Simulation'.
</p>
<p>
    I also started to develop a graphic card set instead of using symbols, though I feel it could be more efficient. This can be seen in the 'displayDigitalCard' function in 'main.h'.

    If you're unfamiliar with counting cards I recommend checking out this tutorial <a href="https://www.blackjackapprenticeship.com/how-to-count-cards/" target="_blank">How to Count Cards</a>. Flash uses the 'Hi-Lo System'.
